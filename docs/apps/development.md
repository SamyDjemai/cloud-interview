# App development

`docker-compose.yml` files have been created to simplify development, and imitate production behavior.
You can run each application's stack by running `docker compose up`.
This will expose the apps on their corresponding ports.

You can also edit the file to set specific environment variables, add services, or change Docker image versions.
